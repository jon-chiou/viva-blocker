# Hand Rolled Ad Blocker for Chromium Browsers

I started using Vivaldi, but its lack of a built-in ad blocker made it seem to be so much slower than Opera or Brave. Not wanting to use a 3rd party ad blocker, I was inspired to make my own after reading [this post by Adrian Stoll](https://www.adrianstoll.com/dyi-adblocker/)

To run this, download the files and run the Python script. You will also have to `chmod` the shell script. If you're on Windows, you'll need to either grab Cygwin or Git Bash or something.

Then, simply go to [vivaldi://extensions](vivaldi://extensions) or [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), etc., turn on Developer mode, click Load unpacked, and choose the directory that you save thess files in. 

This is a work in progress, so please feel free to send me any feedback.
